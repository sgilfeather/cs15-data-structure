# cs15-data-structures
Projects implementing common data structures and algorithms in C++ (with amortized performance analysis!). Implementations of binary trees, hash tables, and graphs for the purpose of huffman coding, file system index, train simulating, and much more...Included in this repo are projects completed for this course, including:
- `MetroSim`: A simulation of the MBTA Green Line, which utilizes queues to organize and optimally move passengers between train stations.
- `CalcYouLater`: An RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator, which utilizes stacks to sequentially process input data and commands.
- `Zap`: A file compressor, similar to `zip`, which utilizes binary trees to implement Huffman coding for lossless data compression.
- `Gerp`: A simple reimplementation of `grep`, which utilizes hash tables to efficiently index and search a local file system.

For the sake of academic integrity, I unfortunately can't make my code for these projects public. However, I can share their specifications and design documents here. If you (a recruiter, a curious developer, etc.) would like to see the source code, shoot me an email at **skylar.gilfeather@gmail.com**. I'd be very happy to share my work with you!
